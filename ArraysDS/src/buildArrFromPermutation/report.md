# Question:

Leetcode 1920. Build Array from Permutation
Given a zero-based permutation nums (0-indexed), build an array ans of the same length where ans[i] = nums[nums[i]] for each 0 <= i < nums.length and return it.

A zero-based permutation nums is an array of distinct integers from 0 to nums.length - 1 (inclusive).

# Algo:

Run a loop, ans[counter] = nums[nums[counter]]

# Complexity:

O(n)
